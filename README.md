# Jobify

This is a website that allows students to find and apply to jobs and it allow employers to add jobs and select studets.

It is done in java and thymeleaf HTML.

This project is based in the project found in https://github.com/Magy2211/SOEN341_PROJECT. This project basically does everything in the other project but with using Spring Boot framework and Thymeleaf HTML instead of java servlets and jsp pages.
